# Hacking Display 🚀

A fun animated "hacking screen" website built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It cycles through background GIFs, displays animated hacking text, and shows blinking dots step by step to simulate a hacking console.

---

## ✨ Features
- Background GIFs change one by one like a hacking animation.
- Text updates dynamically (`Access Granted`, `Hacking Google Account`, etc.).
- Blinking red dots appear one by one with delay for realistic effect.
- Fully responsive design (fits all screen sizes).
- Built using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** — no external libraries.
